"""Classification reciprocal-overlap sweep behind the choice of 0.5.

Where used
----------
Supplementary Note S1 (`manuscript/supplementary.typ`) -> Classification reciprocal overlap threshold:
    Supplementary Figure Classification Overlap  the four-panel sweep
    every number quoted in that subsection

Unlike the other three parameters this one changes neither call set. Both sides
are fixed (benchmark at zero padding, 1 kb floor on each side, consensus built
at 0.5) and only the rule crediting a query call against a benchmark interval
moves, so the whole sweep is a filter over one candidate-pair list per call set.

Two things are worth separating in the result. The metrics decline
monotonically, so the threshold has no interior optimum and cannot be selected
by maximising anything. What does change qualitatively is the *topology*: at or
above 0.5 a query call cannot reach half of each of two benchmark intervals
unless those intervals overlap, so the matching is forced one-to-one; below it
the same call is credited against several intervals at once and the query-side
and truth-side true-positive counts come apart.
