"""Query consensus reciprocal-overlap sweep behind the choice of 0.5.

Where used
----------
Supplementary Note S1 (`manuscript/supplementary.typ`) -> Consensus reciprocal overlap threshold:
    Supplementary Figure Consensus Overlap  the four-panel sweep
    every number quoted in that subsection

This is the only parameter that changes what a *query call is*. A consensus
component is the transitive closure of the pairwise overlaps that clear the
threshold, so lowering it does not merely merge more pairs: it chains. Two calls
that share no bases at all end up in one component whenever a third bridges
them, and the component inherits the union of every member's span.

The direct measure of that is carried here as *span inflation*: the ratio of a
component's span to the span of its longest single member call. A component
whose ratio is 1 is a set of calls agreeing on one event; a ratio of 10 is a
locus collapsed into one interval that no caller reported.

Truth is held fixed throughout (benchmark merged at zero padding, 1 kb floor),
so every recall denominator in the sweep is the same number and the curves are
a property of the query side alone.
