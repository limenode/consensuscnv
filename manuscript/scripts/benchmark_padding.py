"""Benchmark-padding sweep behind the choice of zero padding on the truth side.

Where used
----------
Supplementary Note S1 (`manuscript/supplementary.typ`) -> Benchmark Padding:
    Supplementary Figure Benchmark Padding  the four-panel sweep
    every number quoted in that subsection

Padding is the only parameter that changes what a *truth interval is*. It is
applied to both ends before the benchmark call sets are merged, so a padding of
p bridges any two benchmark intervals separated by at most p and the merged
result inherits the union of their spans.

The subsection's argument is that padding does not act here as a tolerance for
breakpoint imprecision, which is what it is usually reached for. Because the
1 kb size floor is applied *after* merging, padding manufactures truth intervals
out of runs of sub-kilobase fragments that were individually below the detectable
domain. An interval is called *manufactured* here when its longest member record
is itself below the floor, so the interval exists in the truth set only because
padding fused it. Those intervals enter the recall denominator at a detection
rate two orders of magnitude below the rest, so recall falls while the number of
benchmark intervals actually found barely moves.

The script writes two figures. The main one is the four-panel sweep; the
supplement carries the truth-side size distribution and the per-call-set
profiles, which are the same mechanism seen on five more query sets.
