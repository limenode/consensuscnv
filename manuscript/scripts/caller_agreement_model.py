"""Is caller agreement one population or two, and how does each respond to depth?

Where used
----------
Results -> "Sequence-based Consensus Call Set Construction":
    Table 2  size and composition of the agreement categories at 30x
    Table 3  observed against predicted counts, 30x
    Table 4  the two populations refit at every coverage
    Supplementary Table Agreement Categories: the Table 3 breakdown at 6x, 4x, 2x

Fits a single-population null model to the caller-agreement categories: all three
callers draw from one pool of N events and each detects a given event with its
own independent probability p. For the pair-only category that excludes caller
i, the ratio to the all-three category is p_i / (1 - p_i), so each rate follows
from one observed ratio and N follows from the all-three count.

The model has four parameters and the four multi-caller categories supply four
counts, so those categories are reproduced by construction and are not evidence
either way. The test is the three single-caller categories, predicted out of
sample. The model underestimates them by more than an order of magnitude at
every coverage, which is the basis for describing agreement as two populations
rather than one.

Confidence intervals are multinomial resamples of the seven category counts,
refitting the model on each draw, so they carry the sampling uncertainty of the
categories through to the fitted parameters.
