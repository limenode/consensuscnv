"""Size distributions of every call set at the adopted parameters.

Where used
----------
Results -> "CNV Size Distribution Characteristics":
    Table 5   size statistics of the 30x call sets, the SNP array, and the benchmark
    Figure 9  size densities at 30x and of each consensus level across coverages
    every number quoted in that section

Also writes the two supplementary tables that section points at: the full
coverage x call set grid, and the same grid with the mean, quartiles, and
duplication share that the main table leaves out.

Nothing here touches the benchmark comparison. The section is descriptive: what
the callers produce and how that changes with depth, before any call is scored.
The adopted parameters still apply, because they decide which intervals exist --
the 1 kb floor on both sides and the 0.5 reciprocal overlap that builds a
consensus component. Padding and the classification threshold play no part in a
size distribution.
