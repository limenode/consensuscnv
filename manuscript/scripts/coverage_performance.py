"""The 2-of-3 consensus call sets across coverages, against the benchmark and the array.

Where used
----------
Results -> "Performance of 2-of-3 Consensus Call Sets across Coverages":
    Table 7   binary classification of the four coverages and the SNP array
    Figure 11  benchmark recovery as an UpSet plot, and each coverage's
               recoveries crossed with the array's
    Figure 12  precision, recall and F1 against CNV size across coverages,
               for deletions and for duplications
    every number quoted in that section

The consensus level is fixed at 2-of-3 by "Consensus Level Selection", and all
four adopted parameters are fixed, so there is no sweep here: one classification
per call set.

Three quantities the section rests on and this script computes rather than
assumes:

  * the benchmark-recovery indicator matrix. Every call set is classified
    against the *same* merged benchmark, so `truth_matched` is a boolean column
    over one fixed universe of intervals and the five columns can be crossed
    directly. This is what the UpSet plot draws, and it replaces the four
    three-way Venn diagrams of the earlier draft.
  * each coverage's recoveries crossed with the array's, which is the
    replacement-versus-supplement question: how many intervals only one of the
    two recovers, and how many both do.
  * variant class composition, since the sets drift towards duplications as
    depth falls while the benchmark does not, and that shifts the metrics for a
    reason unrelated to depth. The size curves are drawn per class for the same
    reason: pooled, their shape would follow that drift rather than depth.
