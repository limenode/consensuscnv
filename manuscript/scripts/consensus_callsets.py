"""Consensus call set composition across coverages and agreement levels.

Where used
----------
Results -> "Consensus Call Set Construction": the caller-agreement counts behind
Figure 3, and every number in the prose describing how consensus call sets
respond to coverage and to the agreement requirement.

Reports, for each coverage and each agreement level (1/3, 2/3, 3/3), the number
of consensus components, the percentage that are duplications, and the median
size; and, for 30x, the seven caller-agreement regions of Figure 3.

Consensus is a union merge at 50% reciprocal overlap with no padding. All three
levels come off a single merge, since `merge_components` builds components from
the edge selection alone and drops those below `min_sources` only afterwards.
